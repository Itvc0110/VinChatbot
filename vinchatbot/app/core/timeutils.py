The agent had no notion of "now", so it could not answer "what semester am I in?". These helpers

at ingest in ``parsers._date_token_to_iso`` (month >= 9 ⇒ the start year of the academic year). Term

# is course X in?", "when does the term start?", "is today the opening day?", "how long until add/drop?")
# — those flow to the agent (which has the injected date + the get_current_datetime tool). So:
#   • the date branch requires an explicit date/weekday ask WITH a quantifier (bao nhiêu/mấy / "date");
#   • the term/year branch requires BOTH a time-subject word AND an explicit present-time marker
#     ("now/currently/hiện tại/đang/am I in/is it?") — "học kỳ nào" alone is NOT enough.
# Matching is accent-insensitive (Vietnamese diacritics stripped) and case-insensitive.
# Date / weekday "what is it now" asks. The date/number quantifier is anchored to today/now so a
# data question ("Hạn nộp là ngày mấy?" / "what is the deadline date?") is NOT matched.
